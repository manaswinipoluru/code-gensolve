# Algorithm for Shape Detection and Classification

1. Load CSV and organize data by path and segment IDs:
   - Read the CSV file containing segment data.
   - Group data by unique path and segment IDs.
   - Store the organized segment points in a list.

2. For each segment:
   - Draw the segment on a blank canvas.
   - Extract contours using OpenCV.

3. Classify each contour:
   - Compute the tolerance and approximate the contour.
   - Calculate area, perimeter, and circularity of the contour.
   - Classify shape:
     - "Rectangle" if 4 vertices.
     - "Ellipse" if circularity > 0.7.
     - "Freeform" otherwise.

4. Generate points for each shape:
   - For "Ellipse":
     - Calculate center and radius.
     - Generate points along the ellipse.
   - For "Rectangle":
     - Extract and return the corner points.
   - For "Freeform":
     - Use the original contour points.

5. Export identified shapes to a new CSV:
   - Write each shape's details (type, points, etc.) to a CSV file.

6. Visualize the input segments and detected shapes:
   - Plot original segments in one subplot.
   - Plot detected shapes (ellipses, rectangles, freeforms) in another subplot.
